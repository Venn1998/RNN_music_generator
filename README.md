# RNN_music_generator
Implementation of a recurrent neural network for the generation of music, following the work presented in [JamBot: Music Theory Aware Chord Based Generation of Polyphonic Music with LSTMs, by Gino Brunner, Yuyi Wang, Roger Wattenhofer and Jonas Wiesendanger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07682.pdf). Some parts of the code attached is taken from the repository of the authors of the paper. I built a LSTM network to generate chords from MIDI files. Finally, I used the embedding layer of the model to project the chords in 2D (with PCA) and visualize the concept of word2vec: we'll se that the model has learned the Circle of Fifths.
